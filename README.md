## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fopdop4137/casdoor-dotnet-maui-example.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd casdoor-dotnet-maui-example
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have .NET 6 or later installed. Run:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   For iOS or Android, use the following commands based on your target platform:
   ```bash
   dotnet maui run ios
   dotnet maui run android
   ```

6. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/fopdop4137/casdoor-dotnet-maui-example/releases) to download the latest version of the app. Follow the instructions to execute the downloaded file.

## Usage

After successfully running the application, you can begin using it for authentication. The main components include:

- **Login Screen**: Users can enter their credentials to log in.
- **User Dashboard**: Displays user information and authentication status.
- **Settings**: Customize authentication settings and manage user profiles.

### Basic Authentication Flow

1. **User Initiates Login**: The user enters their credentials.
2. **Request to Casdoor**: The app sends a request to the Casdoor server.
3. **Token Received**: Upon successful authentication, the app receives an access token.
4. **Access Protected Resources**: Use the access token to access protected resources.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Login

Here's a simple code snippet for implementing a login feature:

```csharp
public async Task<bool> Login(string username, string password)
{
    var client = new HttpClient();
    var response = await client.PostAsync("https://casdoor.org/api/login", new StringContent(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(new { username, password }), Encoding.UTF8, "application/json"));

    if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        var token = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        // Store token securely
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Example 2: Fetch User Data

Once logged in, you can fetch user data as follows:

```csharp
public async Task<User> GetUserData(string token)
{
    var client = new HttpClient();
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);
    var response = await client.GetAsync("https://casdoor.org/api/user");

    if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        var userData = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<User>(userData);
    }
    return null;
}
```
